The product of these two integers is given as 1,332, so we can write the equation:

x(x + 1) = 1,332

Expanding the left side of the equation:

x^2 + x = 1,332

Rearranging the equation to form a quadratic equation in standard form:

x^2 + x - 1,332 = 0

Now we have a quadratic equation that we can solve using various methods such as factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. In this case, factoring may not be straightforward, so let's use the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

For the quadratic equation x^2 + x - 1,332 = 0, we have a = 1, b = 1, and c = -1,332. Substituting these values into the formula:

x = (-1 ± √(1^2 - 4*1*(-1,332))) / 2*1

x = (-1 ± √(1 + 5,328)) / 2

x = (-1 ± √5,329) / 2

x = (-1 ± 73) / 2

Now, we have two possible solutions for x:

x = (-1 + 73) / 2 = 72 / 2 = 36

x = (-1 - 73) / 2 = -74 / 2 = -37

Since we are looking for positive integers, the value of x can only be 36. Therefore, the larger integer (x + 1) will be:
