Write your answer as a whole number.
centimetersperminute upstream

assistant: Let's first convert the time given in minutes to seconds since it will be easier to work with:

1.6 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 96 seconds

Now that we have the time in seconds, we can use the formula:

Velocity = Distance / Time

Given that the trout swam a distance of 7200 centimeters in 96 seconds, we can calculate the velocity as:

Velocity = 7200 centimeters / 96 seconds = 75 centimeters per second

Since the trout swam directly upstream and passed beneath the woman swimming at 1800 centimeters per minute, we can convert the trout's velocity to centimeters per minute:

75 centimeters/second * 60 seconds/minute = 4500 centimeters per minute

Given that 1 drywall screw weighs 4.4×10^(-3) pounds, we can calculate the weight of 5,000 drywall screws as follows:

Weight of 1 drywall screw = 4.4×10^(-3) pounds

Weight of 5,000 drywall screws = 5,000 * (4.4×10^(-3)) pounds
                                           = 22 pounds

The legs of the triangle are the distances traveled north and west, which are 1 mile and 4 miles, respectively.

Let the distance between the student's home and the point where the student turned west be the hypotenuse of the right triangle.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, the shortest distance can be calculated as:

(shortest distance)^2 = (1 mile)^2 + (4 miles)^2
(shortest distance)^2 = 1 + 16
(shortest distance)^2 = 17

Taking the square root of both sides:
shortest distance = √17 miles

Ingenassistant: FN har ansvaret for flygtningebørn i lejren.user: Nord og syd
Af: Peter Krogholm
Militsen dræbte mine forældre en solrig torsdag eftermiddag.
Vi vidste, at de var på vej igen, men min far nægtede som
sædvanlig at stikke af. Det her var vores hjem, og hvis man
lod sig skræmme væk fra sit hjem, hvad var man så?
Militsen plejede at komme efter mad. Så lige som alle
de andre gange, fik min far arrangeret en indsamling, hvor
alle gav det, de kunne undvære. Det var ikke meget, men tilsammen blev det til en del. Indtil nu havde det altid været
nok.
Min far mødte militsens leder på hovedgaden. Folk
stimlede sammen om dem. Min far fik lov til at sige tre ord,
før jeg hørte et smæld og min mors skrig.
Militsen begyndte at skyde mod de forvirrede og chokerede mennesker, der nu spredte sig i vild panik. Jeg genkendte nogle af drengene i militsen. Før krigen havde jeg
spillet fodbold med dem. På samme hold. Nu stod de med
maskinpistoler og skød andre, jeg kendte, med koldt blod og
narko i årerne.
Gennem larmen fra våbnene hørte jeg min mor råbe, at
jeg skulle følge med hende. Vi slap væk ad en sidegade og
nåede hjem til vores hus. Hun kastede tilfældige ting i min
rygsæk og skubbede mig ud ad bagdøren. Så vendte hun sig
og løb ind i soveværelset. Der gik et minut, så var hun tilbage
og klemte min fars gamle armbåndsur i hånden på mig. I
samme øjeblik kørte en sort og grøn jeep ind i vores indkørsel.
“Tag det her. Det var din farfars. Din far ville have ønsket, at du skulle have det. Og nu skal du flygte. Uanset hvad
der sker, uanset hvad du hører, så skal du løbe. Lov mig det.
Jeg elsker dig,” hviskede hun og lukkede døren bag mig. Jeg
skulle stikke af, men jeg kunne ikke. Jeg sneg mig hen til
hjørnet af huset, hvor jeg kunne se indkørslen. Min mor stod
i hoveddøren og stirrede stift på militslederen. Jeg genkendte
ham som en af de mænd, der havde lagt nyt tag på vores hus
for fem år siden.
Han talte afdæmpet til min mor. Sagde, at hun måtte
komme til fornuft og fortælle, hvor jeg var. Hun kunne være
helt rolig: Han ville bare tale med mig. Modsat min far virkede jeg jo fornuftig. Han var sikker på, at jeg ville kæmpe
på det godes side, hvis bare jeg fik chancen.
“Du vil vel gerne have, at din søn klarer sig godt,
ikke?” sagde han med et lille dæmonisk smil.
“Min søn skal nok klare sig. Du finder ham aldrig. Og
hvis du påstår, at du er det gode, så håber jeg, han slår sig
sammen med det onde selv,” hvislede min mor.
“Nuvel, du er lige så dum og stædig som din mand, kan
jeg forstå. I ville ikke kæmpe, da krigen brød ud, og I ville
ikke flygte, da den var tabt. Jeg har også idealer. Jeg kender
det godt. Du går rundt og tror på noget, og det føles rigtigt.
Men der er bare det ved det, at det nogle gange er forkert. Og
det koster. Der er altid en pris, der skal betales,” sagde han
koldt.
Han nikkede til de tre soldater, han havde med sig. De
gik hen mod min mor. De grinte dumt, da den ene stak hende
en knytnæve i ansigtet. Så trak de hende med sig hen mod
jeepen.
1 PRØVE

Jeg løb.
Jeg aner ikke, hvor længe jeg løb, før jeg til sidst måtte
overgive mig og give mine lunger en pause. Jeg kastede mig
ind i en kornmark. Gemt fra verden lå jeg og stirrede op på
den klare blå himmel. En enkelt sky drev dovent afsted uden
mål.
Et mål. Det måtte jeg have. Jeg blev nødt til at vide,
hvor jeg ville hen. Og hvor jeg slet ikke skulle hen. Ellers
ville jeg ikke klare det. Jeg vidste, at der var fred syd for
grænsen. Men hvilken vej var syd?
Engang havde jeg haft et kompas i min lomme, men
mobilnettet havde ikke virket i flere år, så ingen gik rundt
med telefoner længere. Jeg gennemsøgte min hjerne for andre
løsninger. Nordstjernen! Hvis jeg havde nord, kunne jeg
finde syd. Men kunne jeg vente her, indtil natten faldt på?
Nej, jeg måtte videre nu. Desuden var jeg ikke sikker på, at
jeg kunne udpege Nordstjernen blandt alle de andre stjerner.
Mos og myretuer dukkede op for mit indre blik. Min
gamle biologilærer havde lært mig, hvordan man kunne finde
verdenshjørnerne uden kompas. Man kunne for eksempel se,
hvor mosset groede på træer, og hvor myrerne byggede deres
tuer. Der var bare ingen træer eller myretuer på en kornmark.
Men så slog det mig: uret. Min farfars armbåndsur. Det var et
gammelt ur med visere, og med sådan et kunne jeg finde syd.
Jeg fandt det frem. Det gik, som det skulle. Klokken
var 17. Jeg pegede den lille viser mod solen. Så forestillede
jeg mig en ret linje lige midt mellem den lille viser og 12-tallet.
Det er et år siden nu. Jeg slap væk. Til Tyskland og det
danske mindretal.
Jeg bor i den lille by Lyksborg. Hos et ældre ægtepar,
der tog mig ind, efter jeg havde boet i en flygtningelejr uden
for Flensborg i nogle måneder. Det er okay at bo hos dem, og
jeg snakker næsten flydende tysk.
Det er i hvert fald bedre end lejren. Jeg vidste aldrig,
om jeg ville overleve dagen, når jeg vågnede. Hvis jeg da
havde sovet for larmen fra slagsmål, mareridt og vagternes
skyderi. Hver dag var en kamp for mad og drikke. I starten
gik der nogle gange flere dage mellem, at jeg spiste. Indtil
jeg lærte reglerne og rytmerne.
Jeg var lykkelig, da de sagde, at jeg kunne flytte fra lejren. Jeg får aldrig mine forældre igen, men det her er et godt
sted at være, indtil jeg en dag skal videre.
Jeg kan se over til Danmark fra stranden. Der er stadig
krig. Nyhederne fortæller hver dag om massakrer på civile.
Der er ingen af militserne, der er stærke nok til at vinde over
de andre, så de prøver at skræmme folk til at holde med dem.
Jeg savner min mor og far. Jeg hader dem, der slog
dem ihjel. Det er det eneste, jeg gør. Hele dagen. Savner og
hader. Undtagen når jeg er i skole. Så får jeg fred i nogle timer. Så giver min hjerne sig selv fri til at lave noget andet.
Til at lære.
Til at skrive det her.
“Nå, er I ved at være færdige?” spørger vores lærer og
ser på mig. “Nord, hvad med dig — hvad har du skrevet

“Nej!”
“Hvad mener du? Nej hvad?” spørger min lærer forvir-
“Jeg takker ikke Gud. Hvorfor skulle jeg det?”
Min lærer siger, at det var Guds vilje, at jeg overlevede.
At jeg slap væk og nåede til Tyskland. At jeg nu bor hos en
god familie i en fredelig by.
“Hvad havde Gud med det at gøre?” spørger jeg.
“Gud har med alt at gøre. Gud er overalt. Gud er i alt.
Ingenting sker, uden Gud vil det.”
“Hvorfor startede han krigen?” spørger jeg. “Hvis han
ikke havde startet krigen, var mine forældre ikke døde, og jeg
havde ikke været her. Og hvorfor har han ikke bare stoppet
krigen?”
“Nu var det jo ikke Gud, der startede krigen …” forsøger min lærer sig.
“Men hvorfor lod han det ske? Ingenting sker, uden
Gud vil det!”
Det kan min lærer ikke svare på. For vi kan naturligvis
ikke vide, hvad Guds planer er, siger hun. Jeg har lyst til at
spørge, hvordan vi så kan vide, at det var Guds vilje, at jeg
skulle overleve, men jeg lader være.
Jeg forstår ikke, hvordan det kan give mening at tale om
Gud. Det var religion, der startede krigen. Derfor kan det aldrig blive religion, der vil afslutte den. Muslimerne blev fordrevet fra Danmark for længe siden. Alligevel bliver der stadig kæmpet. Kristne mod kristne. Dem, der ville udrense de
fremmede, mod dem, der ikke kaldte dem fremmede. Jeg tror
bare ikke, det er det, krigen handler om længere.
Skolen slutter for i dag. Jeg følges ud med Adam. Min
bedste ven. Vi vil ned og bade. Jeg kan se Danmark fra stranden.
Ingen troede, det kunne ske hos os.
Og så var det for sent. assistant: Dette tekstuddrag handler om en ung dreng, der mister sine forældre til en milits, flygter fra sit hjemland og ender i Tyskland hos en plejefamilie. Han gennemgår en række traumatiske oplevelser, herunder at være i en flygtningelejr og miste sine forældre. Han reflekterer over religion, Gud og krigens grusomhed. Til sidst beskriver han, hvordan han nu har venner og en ny start i Tyskland, men stadig kæmper med savn og had til dem, der slog hans forældre ihjel.user:  Folk i byen

My name is Hassan al Shamsi. I am writing my school project about sharing fridges during the the Holy 
Month of Ramadan. Ramadan is a time for prayer and re!ection. It is also a time to be generous and to 
give to those who need it. Many people donate to charity, or invite people to meals to break their fast. 
Now many people are starting to share fridges to give food to those who need it the most. 
1 
Many people saw workers in their communities working in very hot weather, sometimes over 45 
degrees Celsius. During Ramadan, this was even more di!cult because they were fasting all day. 
One woman in Dubai had an idea to help them. The most important thing was to give workers a 
place where they could get food and drinks to break their fast. She put a fridge outside her house 
""lled with food and drinks. Her idea came to the attention of others. Soon many people were doing 
the same thing. Now the aim of the project is to help workers all over the UAE have a place to get 
food and drinks to break their fast during Ramadan. 
2 
There are many ways that people can help the project. The ""rst step is to talk to building managers. 
People in apartments and o!ces must get their permission to have a sharing fridge. Next, people 
need to talk to the team leaders. There are 13 team leaders and they are volunteers. They help 
manage fridge locations. Finally, there are other ways to help, too. Some people work to re""ll the 
fridges. Others help organize the food contributions and arrange for them to go to fridges that 
need it most. They also pack food into food parcels. Others have developed a map that people can 
use to ""nd the location of the nearest sharing fridge to them. There are so many ways to help; it is 
truly a whole community team e#ort to help those in need during such a special time of the year.
3 
This has become a very successful project. This year, there are already over 170 fridges. Several 
schools in the Dubai area have also started their own sharing fridges as a school project. Most 
fridges feed over 100 people every day, some feed two to three times as many. Many people who 
participate in the Ramadan fridge project say that they must re""ll their fridges often, as quickly as 
every 15 minutes. They provide food to thousands of workers. The main thing is to always help

“wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
I was a bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in her flowered dress-and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle of Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.
""'Gratulate me,"" she muttered. ""Never had a drink before, but oh how I do enjoy it.""
""What's the matter, Daisy?""
I was scared, I can tell you; I'd never seen a girl like that before.
""Here, deares."" She groped around in a waste-basket she had with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls.
""Take 'em down-stairs and give 'em back to whoever they belong to. Tell 'em all Daisy's change her mine. Say: 'Daisy's change her mine!'""
She began to cry—she cried and cried. I rushed out and found her mother's maid, and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath. She wouldn't let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up into a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the soap-dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.
But she didn't say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress, and half an hour later, when we walked out of the room, the pearls were around her neck and the incident was over. Next day at five o clock she married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a three months' trip to the South Seas. •
I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back, and I thought I'd never seen a girl so mad about her husband. If he”

""Where's Tom gone?"" and wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the door. She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour, rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight. It was touching to see them together—it made you laugh in a hushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night, and ripped a front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got into the papers, too, because her arm was broken—she was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.
The next April Daisy had her little girl, and they went to France for a year. I saw them one spring in Cannes, and later in Deauville, and then they came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in Chicago, as you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation.
Perhaps because she doesn't drink. It's a great advantage not to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue, and, moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they don't see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at all— and yet there's something in that voice of hers....
Well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first time in years. It was when I asked you—do you remember?—if you knew Gatsby in West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up, and said: ""What Gatsby?"" and when I described him—I was half asleep— she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know. It wasn't until then that I connected this Gatsby with the officer in her white car.”

“When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a victoria through Central Park. The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in the West Fifties, and the clear voices of little girls, already gathered like crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:
""I'm the Sheik of Araby.
Your love belongs to me.
At night when you're asleep
Into your tent I'll creep-
""
""It was a strange coincidence,"" I said
""But it wasn't a coincidence at all.""
""Why not?""
""Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay.""
Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that June night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendor.
""He wants to know,"" continued Jordan, ""if you'll invite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over.""
The modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths—so that he could ""come over"" some afternoon to a stranger's garden.
""Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?""
""He's afraid, he's waited so long. He thought you might be offended. You see, he's a regular tough underneath it all.""”

Explain how you found your answer.assistant: To find when the object will hit the ground, we need to determine when the height of the object is equal to zero. In other words, we need to find the value of t when h(t) = 0.

Given that h(t) = 80t - 16t^2, we set h(t) = 0:

0 = 80t - 16t^2

This is a quadratic equation, so we can solve for t by factoring or using the quadratic formula. Factoring, we get:

0 = 16t(5 - t)

Setting each factor equal to zero, we find:

16t = 0 or 5 - t = 0

From 16t = 0, we find that t = 0. This represents the time when the object was launched.

From 5 - t = 0, we find that t = 5. This represents the time when the object hits the ground.

Therefore, the object will hit the ground 5 seconds after it is launched.user: Brahmagupta’s book is the oldest text representing zero as a number, using the symbol 0. Why was this a mathematical breakthrough? assistant: Brahmagupta's use of zero as a number represented a mathematical breakthrough for several reasons:

1. Conceptualizing zero as a number: Before Brahmagupta's time, the concept of zero was often seen as a placeholder or as indicating an absence of a quantity. By treating zero as a number in its own right, Brahmagupta paved the way for the development of mathematical ideas and calculations that would not have been possible without the formal recognition of zero as a numerical value.

2. Simplifying calculations: The inclusion of zero as a number allowed for more efficient and accurate calculations. It enabled the development of arithmetic operations involving zero, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This in turn made mathematical calculations more systematic and easier to perform.

3. Advancements in algebra: Brahmagupta's recognition of zero as a number laid the foundation for the development of algebraic concepts and equations. The incorporation of zero into algebraic expressions allowed for the manipulation of variables and constants in ways that were not previously possible, leading to new mathematical discoveries and advancements.

Overall, Brahmagupta's introduction of zero as a number was a significant mathematical breakthrough because it revolutionized the way numbers were understood and manipulated, opening up new possibilities for mathematical exploration and discovery.user: The product of two consecutive positive integers is 1,332. Explain how you can write and solve a quadratic equation to find the value of the larger integer.","To find two consecutive positive integers whose product is 1,332, we can let the first integer be \(n\) and the second (consecutive) integer be \(n + 1\). The product of these two integers is given as 1,332. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[n(n + 1) = 1,332\]

Expanding this equation gives us a quadratic equation:

\[n^2 + n - 1,332 = 0",gpt-4-turbo-preview,"Let's denote the smaller integer as x and the larger integer as x + 1, since they are consecutive positive integers.

The product of these two integers is given as 1,332, so we can write the equation:

x(x + 1) = 1,332

Expanding the left side of the equation:

x^2 + x = 1,332

Rearranging the equation to form a quadratic equation in standard form:

x^2 + x - 1,332 = 0

Now we have a quadratic equation that we can solve using various methods such as factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. In this case, factoring may not be straightforward, so let's use the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

For the quadratic equation x^2 + x - 1,332 = 0, we have a = 1, b = 1, and c = -1,332. Substituting these values into the formula:

x = (-1 ± √(1^2 - 4*1*(-1,332))) / 2*1

x = (-1 ± √(1 + 5,328)) / 2

x = (-1 ± √5,329) / 2

x = (-1 ± 73) / 2

Now, we have two possible solutions for x:

x = (-1 + 73) / 2 = 72 / 2 = 36

x = (-1 - 73) / 2 = -74 / 2 = -37

Since we are looking for positive integers, the value of x can only be 36. Therefore, the larger integer (x + 1) will be:

36 + 1 = 37

So, the larger integer is 37.",gpt-3.5-turbo-0125
